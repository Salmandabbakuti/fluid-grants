# FluidGrants

FluidGrants is a decentralized grant management platform designed to revolutionize the way hackathon-style grants are distributed and managed. It leverages Superfluidâ€™s real-time finance protocols to ensure seamless and fair distribution of funds based on community votes.

Participants can create grants, submit projects, and allow a panel of judges to vote on the best submissions. Once the judging period is complete, FluidGrants automatically distributes the total grant pool to the top projects, weighted by the number of votes received.

The platform ensures transparency, accountability, and fairness by utilizing Superfluid's distribution pools, where grant amounts flow dynamically to project creators in real-time based on votes. This model encourages participation and rewards innovation by streamlining the process from submission to funding.

### Features

Grant Creation: Organizers can set up new grants, specifying the total grant amount, submission deadlines, and judging periods.

Project Submission: Users can submit their projects, along with relevant details such as repository links and demo URLs, during the submission window.

Voting Mechanism: Judges vote on the submitted projects during the judging period, with votes tied directly to the distribution of the grant pool.

Real-Time Distribution: After voting, the total grant amount is distributed to projects in real-time using Superfluid's distribution pools, ensuring instant and fair payouts based on votes.

Transparency and Accountability: All transactions, votes, and fund distributions are on-chain, promoting transparency and reducing the risk of centralized control or manipulation.

FluidGrants provides a decentralized solution for hackathons, innovation challenges, and community grants, enabling efficient fund distribution while promoting innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.
